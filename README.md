## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a QA Engineer with 4+ years of experience testing complex web and backend systems. I specialize in Java + Selenium automation, enjoy tackling tricky logic, and believe in catching bugs early with a Shift-Left mindset. Quality, clarity, and collaboration are what drive me every day.
